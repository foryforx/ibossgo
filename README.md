#Â Golang with Google OAuth + postgres backend(option to move to mongo) + sql migration + clean architecture

Got kick start from (https://github.com/Skarlso/goprogressquest).

# Installation

Simply `go get github.com/karuppaiah/golang-oauth-postgres-clean-architecture`.

# Setup

## Google

In order for the Google Authentication to work, you'll need developer credentials which the this application gathers from a file in the root directory called `creds.json`. The structure of this file should be like this:

```json
{
  "cid":"hash.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "csecret":"somesecrethash"
}
```

To obtain these credentials, please navigate to this site and follow the procedure to setup a new project: [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects).

## Dependencies

To gather all the libraries this project uses, simply execute from the root: `go get -v ./...`

# Running
